A simple Python srcipt that applies Touhou characters' hats as fastfetch logo

![example](screenshots/example1.png)

# Installation


```
cd ~/.config/fastfetch

git clone https://github.com/pwoertnehsi/fastfetch-touhou-hats
```

Note: fastfetch doesn't make a directory in ~/.config when you install it, so you might need to create one.

Then, cd into the cloned repo and run bin/ffth. Additionally, you can add this binary to your PATH via running this command so that you can change the hat at any moment.

```
export PATH=$PATH:~/.config/fastfetch/fastfetch-touhou-hats/bin
```

# Usage

Beware that config.jsonc.bak is overriden if it already exists and you've chosen to backup!

# Character List

These are the characters whose hats are available. Links are the arts that I've traced the hats from.
